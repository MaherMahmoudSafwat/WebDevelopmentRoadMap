Difference between .exe and .dll:
.exe (Executable):

A standalone application that can run on its own.
When you double-click, it starts a process.
Example: notepad.exe launches Notepad.
.dll (Dynamic Link Library):

A library of code used by other applications.
Cannot run on its own – it must be loaded by an .exe or another program.
Example: user32.dll provides Windows UI functions.
Key Difference:
.exe = Entry point for execution.
.dll = Shared code used by multiple programs.

A .dll is more like a toolbox or library – it contains reusable functions, classes, and resources that other programs can call.
