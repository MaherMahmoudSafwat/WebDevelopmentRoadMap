Console App vs Class Library:
Console App:

Creates an executable (.exe).
Runs in a console/terminal window.
Has a Main method (entry point) and executes independently.
Class Library:

Creates a library (.dll).
No entry point â€“ cannot run on its own.
Provides reusable code (classes, methods) for other apps to use.
Key Difference:

Console App = Standalone program.
Class Library = Reusable component for other projects.
