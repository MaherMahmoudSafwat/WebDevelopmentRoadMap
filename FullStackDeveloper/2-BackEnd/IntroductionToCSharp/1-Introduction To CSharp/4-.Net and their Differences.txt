Limitations:
Windows-exclusive
Not actively developed for new projects (replaced by .NET Core/.NET).
2. .NET Core (2016)
Description:
A cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS) rewrite of .NET Framework.
Designed for high performance and scalability.
Languages: C#, F#
Key Technologies:
ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core, Blazor
Advantages:
Lightweight, modular, open-source
Ideal for microservices, cloud apps.
End of Life:
Merged into .NET 5 and later versions.
3. .NET (5 and Later) (2020 - Present)
Description:
Unified platform – merges .NET Core and .NET Framework features.
Cross-platform, high performance, open-source.
Languages: C#, F#, VB.NET (limited for desktop)
Key Technologies:
ASP.NET Core, MAUI (Mobile/Desktop UI), Blazor
Advantages:
One platform for web, desktop, mobile, cloud, and IoT.
4. .NET Standard (2016 - Deprecated)

A specification (not a framework) to ensure compatibility between .NET Framework, .NET Core, and Xamarin.
Goal:
Write libraries that work across all .NET implementations.
Replaced By:
.NET 5+ (standardized platform).
5. Mono/Xamarin (2004)

Mono: Early open-source .NET implementation (used in Linux).
Xamarin: Built on Mono, used for mobile development (iOS/Android).
Languages: C#, F#
Current Status:
Merged into .NET MAUI (Mobile and Desktop UI).
Key Differences:
Type	Platform	Focus Area	Status
.NET Framework	Windows Only	Desktop, Web, Enterprise	Legacy (No new features)
.NET Core	Cross-platform	Modern Web, Cloud, Microservices	Merged into .NET
.NET (5+)	Cross-platform	Unified platform (Web, Desktop, Mobile)	Actively developed
Xamarin	iOS, Android	Mobile apps	Replaced by MAUI
.NET Standard	Multi-platform	Library compatibility	Deprecated
History Overview:
2002: .NET Framework 1.0 (Windows desktop apps)
2016: .NET Core (cross-platform, faster, modular)
2020: .NET 5 – Unified platform for all apps
2021+: .NET 6, 7, 8 – Continuous improvements with each release
