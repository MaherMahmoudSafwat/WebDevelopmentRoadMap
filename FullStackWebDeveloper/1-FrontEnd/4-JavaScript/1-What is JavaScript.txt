JavaScript is a programming language used to make websites interactive.

It runs in web browsers and allows you to:

Add dynamic behavior (e.g., show/hide content).
Respond to user actions (like clicking buttons or submitting forms).
Update content without reloading the page (for example, live search results).
JavaScript works alongside HTML (for structure) and CSS (for styling) to create modern, responsive websites.

In short, JavaScript makes websites more interactive, engaging, and functional.
