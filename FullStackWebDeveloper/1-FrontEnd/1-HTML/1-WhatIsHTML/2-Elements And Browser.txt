View Page Source vs Inspect â€“ Explained Simply
When you visit a website, the browser downloads code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) from the server to display the page. There are two ways to see this code:

1. View Page Source
What it Shows:
The original HTML and CSS that the browser receives before JavaScript changes anything.

How to Access:

Right-click anywhere on the page.
Select View Page Source.
A new tab opens showing the raw HTML/CSS.
Use Case:

Good for seeing the basic structure of the site.
Useful for learning how a page is built.
ðŸ”¹ Example:
Think of it as reading the blueprint of a house before it is built.

2. Inspect (Developer Tools)
What it Shows:
The live, current version of the webpage. It reflects changes made by JavaScript or dynamic content loaded after the page initially loads.

How to Access:

Right-click on any part of the website.
Select Inspect (or press F12 or Ctrl + Shift + I).
A panel opens showing the DOM (Document Object Model), which is the page as it exists right now.
Use Case:

Lets you edit HTML/CSS in real-time to see how the page changes.
Helpful for debugging, testing layouts, and modifying styles.
ðŸ”¹ Example:
Itâ€™s like inspecting the house after it is built and decorated.
