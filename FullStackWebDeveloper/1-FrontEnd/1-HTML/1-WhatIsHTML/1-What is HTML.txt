HTML is the standard language used to create and design web pages. It structures content on the web by using a series of elements or tags. These elements are the building blocks of web content.

Key Concepts of HTML:
Markup Language:

HTML is a markup language, meaning it uses tags to define the structure and elements of a webpage.
Tags provide instructions to the browser on how to display content (text, images, links, etc.).

Why HTML is Important:
Foundation of Web Pages: Every webpage is built using HTML as the backbone. It's essential for displaying text, images, and other media.
Structure and Organization: HTML provides a way to structure content, making it accessible and readable both to users and search engines.

Whatâ€™s Next After HTML?
After mastering HTML, you'll want to move on to CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to style your pages, and JavaScript to add interactivity.
