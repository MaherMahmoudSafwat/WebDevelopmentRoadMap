This is the DOCTYPE for HTML5.
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<!--Standard Mode
The browser follows modern web standards and displays the page correctly.
Layouts, CSS, and JavaScript work the way they are supposed to.
This happens when you use the correct DOCTYPE at the top of the HTML file.
-->
<!-- Quirks Mode
The browser uses old, less accurate rules (like from the 1990s).
This can make your webpage look strange or broken.
Quirks mode happens when:
You forget to add DOCTYPE.
You use an old or incorrect DOCTYPE.

<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <meta name="description" content="This is a BookStore"/>

            BookStore
        </title>
    </head>
    <body>
        BookStore
    </body>
</html>
