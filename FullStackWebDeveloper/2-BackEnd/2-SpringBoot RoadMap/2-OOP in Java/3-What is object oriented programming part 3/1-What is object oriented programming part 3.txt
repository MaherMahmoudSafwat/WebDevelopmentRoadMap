What is Class ? and why do we need it ? 
What is a Class?
A class is like a template or blueprint. It defines the common features and behaviors for objects created from it.

Why Do We Need a Class?
Organization: Helps group related things together.
Reusability: Once the class is defined, you can create multiple objects from it.
Encapsulation: Protects and organizes data related to the object.
Example: Car Class
Imagine a class called Car. This class has:

Attributes (properties): like color, model, and speed.
Behaviors (methods): like starting the engine or driving.
Visualization of Car Class:

+-------------------+
|       Car         |
+-------------------+
| - color: String   |
| - model: String   |
| - speed: int      |
+-------------------+
| + startEngine()   |
| + drive()         |
+-------------------+
Here, the Car class defines that every car object will have a color, model, and speed, and can perform startEngine() and drive().

Creating 3 Objects from the Car Class:
Now, we create 3 objects (cars) from this class:

+---------------------+     +---------------------+     +---------------------+
|       Car 1         |     |       Car 2         |     |       Car 3         |
+---------------------+     +---------------------+     +---------------------+
| color: Red          |     | color: Blue         |     | color: Black        |
| model: Tesla        |     | model: BMW          |     | model: Audi         |
| speed: 120          |     | speed: 100          |     | speed: 150          |
+---------------------+     +---------------------+     +---------------------+
| startEngine()       |     | startEngine()       |     | startEngine()       |
| drive()             |     | drive()             |     | drive()             |
+---------------------+     +---------------------+     +---------------------+
Car 1: A Red Tesla with speed 120.
Car 2: A Blue BMW with speed 100.
Car 3: A Black Audi with speed 150.
Each of these cars is an object created from the Car class.

Summary:
A class is a blueprint or template (like a cookie cutter).
An object is a specific instance (like a cookie made from the cutter).
You can create multiple objects (cars) from a single class (Car).
This organization makes it easier to work with multiple objects that share the same structure but have different values.
