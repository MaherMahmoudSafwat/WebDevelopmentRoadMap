Objects and Classes
Classes: Where Objects Come From
-A class is code that describes a particular type of object. It specifies the data that object can hold (the object's fields), and the actions that an object can perform (the object's methods).

-you can think of a class as a code "blueprint" that can be used to create a particular type of object.

-When a program is running, it can use the class to create, in memory, as many objects of a specific type as needed.

-Each object that is created from a class is called an instance of the class. 

Example: 

                  This expression creates
		  a Scanner object in memory
                             |
                  -----------------------
                  |			|
Scanner input = new Scanner (System.in);
	 |        |
	 |        |
         |--------|
	      |
          The object's
	memory address is
	assigned to the input
	variable.

Input				Scanner
Variable ----------------------> Object


                  This expression 
                  creates a Random 
                  object in memory
                        |
                  -----------
                  |	    |		|
Random rand = new Random ();
	 |        |
	 |        |
         |--------|
	      |
          The object's
	memory address is
	assigned to the rand
	variable.

rand				Random
Variable ----------------------> Object
Address is stored in rand variable
note :- Address is stored in rand variable that is declared by an object.
