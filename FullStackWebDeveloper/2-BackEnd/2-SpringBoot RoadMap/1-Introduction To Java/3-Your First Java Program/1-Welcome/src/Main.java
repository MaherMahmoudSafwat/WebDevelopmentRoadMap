        //System is a class found in java.lang Packages.
        //out is an object instance of printstream datatype class inside System Class
        //println is a method inside printstream class that takes a string to print it in a console.
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
        //so source code is compiled by javac to get the bytecode for any Cross Platform then it turns to machine code to run.
        //Source Code (.java): Written in Java.
        //Compilation (javac): Converts to platform-independent bytecode (.class).
        //Execution (JVM): Translates bytecode to platform-specific machine code and runs it.

        // Errors in Programming: Summary
        // =======================================
        //
        // 1. Syntax Error:
        //    - What is it?
        //      An error in the code structure that violates the rules of the programming language.
        //    - When does it occur?
        //      Detected during compilation (before the program runs).
        //    - Effect:
        //      The program will not compile or run until the error is fixed.
        //    - Example: Missing a semicolon or using invalid syntax.
        //      System.out.println("Hello World) // Missing closing quotation mark.
        //
        // 2. Runtime Error:
        //    - What is it?
        //      An error that occurs while the program is running, usually due to invalid operations.
        //    - When does it occur?
        //      Detected during program execution.
        //    - Effect:
        //      The program crashes or behaves unexpectedly.
        //    - Example: Division by zero or accessing an invalid index in an array.
        //      int result = 10 / 0; // Division by zero causes a runtime error.
        //
        // 3. Logical Error:
        //    - What is it?
        //      A mistake in the program's logic that produces incorrect results, even though the program runs without crashing.
        //    - When does it occur?
        //      Detected only by testing the program's output.
        //    - Effect:
        //      The program runs successfully but produces the wrong results.
        //    - Example: Using incorrect formulas or logic.
        //      int sum = a - b; // Intended to add 'a' and 'b', but used subtraction.
        //
        // =======================================
        // Summary:
        // - Syntax Error: Detected during compilation. Prevents the program from running.
        // - Runtime Error: Detected during execution. Causes the program to crash.
        // - Logical Error: Detected during testing. Produces incorrect results.
        //
