1-What is Programming and Program Development Life Cycle ?
Programming is a Process of Problem Solving

Step 1: Analyze The Problem 
- Understand the Overall Problem

-Define Problem Requirements
 . Does Program require user interaction ? 
   - if yes, What is the input ?
 . What is the Expected output ? 

- Design steps(algorithm) to solve the problem.

Algorithm:
-----------
	Step-by-Step Problem-Solving process.

The Programmer Should Focus on Three Parts:-
Input,Processing,Output

Step 2: Implement the Algorithm
- Implement the algorithm in code.
- Verify that the algorithm works.

Step 3: Maintenance
- Use and Modify the program if the problem domain Changes.

if the problem is complex, divide it into sub-problems.
	Analyze each sub-problem as above 



Example
Write a program to find the area of a rectangle.
The area of the Rectangle are Given by the following formula:-
	Area = Rect Length * Rect Width

Input :
------- 
			Rectangle Length, Rectangle Width.
Processing :
------------
			Area = Rect Length * Rect Width.
Output :
--------
			Print Out The Area. 





To Sum it up......
			Think Then Write Code.
