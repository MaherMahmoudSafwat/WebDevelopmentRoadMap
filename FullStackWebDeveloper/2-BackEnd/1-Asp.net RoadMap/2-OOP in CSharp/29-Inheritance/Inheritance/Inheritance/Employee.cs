    // ✅ Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class.
    // ✅ The "base class" (parent) provides shared functionality.
    // ✅ The "derived class" (child) extends the base class and can override its methods.
    // ✅ Promotes code reusability and a hierarchical class structure.
    // ✅ The child class can have additional properties and methods.
    // ✅ A child class can override parent methods using the "override" keyword.
    // ✅ A parent class can prevent overriding using "sealed" keyword.
    // ✅ The "base" keyword is used to call parent class methods or constructors.
    // ✅ Supports single inheritance, meaning a class can inherit from only one class.
    // ✅ Inheritance is one of the four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
