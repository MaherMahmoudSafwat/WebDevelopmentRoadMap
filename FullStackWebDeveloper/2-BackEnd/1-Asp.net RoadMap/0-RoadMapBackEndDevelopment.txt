Becoming a Full-Stack .NET Web Developer involves mastering frontend, backend, database, DevOps, and software architecture. Here's a structured roadmap:

1️⃣ Fundamentals of Programming
✅ C# Basics: Data types, variables, loops, conditions, functions
✅ OOP in C#: Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, interfaces
✅ SOLID Principles: Writing scalable and maintainable code
✅ Design Patterns: Singleton, Factory, Repository, Dependency Injection

2️⃣ Backend Development with .NET
✅ .NET Core & .NET 6/7/8: Learn the framework basics
✅ ASP.NET Core MVC & Web API: Build web apps & RESTful APIs
✅ Entity Framework Core (EF Core): Database handling with ORM
✅ Dependency Injection: Managing application dependencies
✅ Middleware & Filters: Customizing request/response pipeline
✅ Authentication & Authorization: Identity, JWT, OAuth, Role-based access

3️⃣ Database Management
✅ SQL Server & SQL Queries: CRUD operations, joins, stored procedures
✅ NoSQL Databases (MongoDB, Redis): Alternative data storage
✅ Database Migrations: Code-first & DB-first approaches
✅ Caching Mechanisms: Improve performance using Redis, MemoryCache

4️⃣ Frontend Development
✅ HTML, CSS, JavaScript: Core web technologies
✅ Bootstrap / Tailwind CSS: Responsive UI frameworks
✅ JavaScript Frameworks: Learn React.js or Angular for interactive UI
✅ State Management: Redux (React), NgRx (Angular)
✅ REST API Integration: Fetching data from .NET Web API

5️⃣ DevOps & Deployment
✅ Version Control: Git, GitHub/GitLab, CI/CD Pipelines
✅ Containerization: Docker & Kubernetes for microservices
✅ Cloud Platforms: Azure, AWS, or Google Cloud for hosting
✅ Monitoring & Logging: Serilog, Application Insights, Log4Net

6️⃣ Software Architecture & Best Practices
✅ Layered Architecture: Separation of concerns (Controllers, Services, Repositories)
✅ Clean Architecture / Onion Architecture: Better project organization
✅ Microservices vs Monolithic: Choosing the right architecture
✅ Testing: Unit testing (xUnit, NUnit), Integration testing

7️⃣ Advanced Topics & Real-World Projects
✅ WebSockets & SignalR: Real-time communication (chat apps, notifications)
✅ GraphQL: Alternative to REST API
✅ Message Queues: RabbitMQ, Kafka for async processing
✅ Performance Optimization: Async programming, caching, database indexing

📌 Final Step: Build a Real-World Full-Stack .NET Project
🔥 Project Idea: Develop an E-commerce Platform
1️⃣ Frontend: React/Angular + Bootstrap
2️⃣ Backend: ASP.NET Core Web API
3️⃣ Database: SQL Server with EF Core
4️⃣ Authentication: JWT + Role-based Authorization
5️⃣ Payment Gateway Integration: Stripe or PayPal
6️⃣ Deployment: Host on Azure/AWS with Docker
