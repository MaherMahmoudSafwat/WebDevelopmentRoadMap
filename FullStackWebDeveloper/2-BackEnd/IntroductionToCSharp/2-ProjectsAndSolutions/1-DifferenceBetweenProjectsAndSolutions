In Visual Studio 2022:

Solution – A container that holds one or more projects. It acts like a workspace, managing dependencies between multiple projects.

Project – A single application or library. It contains files (code, resources, configs) needed to build that application.

Key Differences:
Scope:

Solution: Manages multiple projects.
Project: Manages code/files for one application.
Purpose:

Solution: Organizes large systems with multiple interrelated projects (like a web app + API + library).
Project: Focuses on building one executable, library, or service.
Example:

A solution for "E-Commerce App" may contain:
Frontend Project (React or Angular)
Backend Project (C# API)
Shared Library Project
This structure allows better organization and easier collaboration.
