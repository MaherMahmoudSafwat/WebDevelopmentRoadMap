What is .NET?
.NET is a free, open-source development platform created by Microsoft for building different types of applications, including:

Web apps (ASP.NET)
Desktop apps (Windows Forms, WPF)
Mobile apps (Xamarin/.NET MAUI)
Games (Unity)
Cloud services
IoT apps
Key Features of .NET:
Cross-Platform â€“ Develop apps that run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Multiple Languages â€“ Supports C#, F#, and Visual Basic.
High Performance â€“ Fast and optimized for modern app development.
Large Ecosystem â€“ Rich libraries and frameworks for various types of development.
Unified Platform â€“ Write code once and use it across web, mobile, and desktop.
Types of .NET:
.NET Core (Now .NET 5+):

Cross-platform and modern.
Used for web, cloud, and desktop apps.
Current version: .NET 8 (2024).
.NET Framework (Older):

Windows-only.
Legacy apps still use it, but itâ€™s gradually being replaced by .NET Core.
Xamarin/.NET MAUI:

Build mobile apps for iOS and Android.
.NET MAUI is the latest evolution for cross-platform mobile and desktop apps.
Why Learn .NET?
Versatile â€“ Build almost any kind of app.
In Demand â€“ Used widely in enterprise software and web development.
Strong Community and Support â€“ Backed by Microsoft and a large developer community.

.NET provides a huge set of pre-built libraries, frameworks, and tools that save you time and effort. Instead of writing everything from scratch, you can use these ready-made components to handle:

Web development â€“ With ASP.NET for websites and web apps.
Database access â€“ Through Entity Framework for easy database interaction.
User Interfaces (UI) â€“ Using Windows Forms, WPF, or Blazor.
Networking, File Handling, Security â€“ Pre-built libraries handle these for you.
Mobile Development â€“ With Xamarin/.NET MAUI for iOS and Android.
